					<p class="card-text" data-transkey="xamulaiChasingMyDreams">I'm chasing my dreams, but I still couldn't make money for what I wanted to do, and I had no choice but to work and I was in conflict, so I joined from YOUTUBE. I really feel that the scales fall from my eyes. Mr. XAMULAI conveys valuable know-how based on his own real experience, and he can learn in the shortest time that self-education would be a detour for many years. Thanks to you, I am really grateful that I can start earning while doing what I want to do!</p>

					<p class="card-text" data-transkey="xamulaiParticipatedBecause">I participated because I wanted to improve myself. There are various online salons, but Mr. XAMULAI tells us not only about business but also about making life happier and more fulfilling and living. Just having money does not mean that you are happy. I learned the two really deeply and was greatly influenced by it. I'm looking forward to the content every week!</p>

					<p class="card-text" data-transkey="xamulaiSeveralBusiness">I went to several business salons, but most of them earned money from Japanese partners even when they were abroad. Mr. XAMULAI speaks three languages and is doing business directly locally in several countries, and also doing venture business of cutting-edge technology, so there are many things that can be learned and surprised. I got good advice and just started an overseas business last month!</p>
